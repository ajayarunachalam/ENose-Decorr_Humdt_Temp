Online decorrelation of humidity and temperature in chemical sensors for continuous monitoring
====

In this repository, you will find snippets of code to exemplify how to import, organize and plot data from one of our recently published datasets, available on UCI Machine Learning repository.The dataset contains recordings of a gas sensor array (picture below) composed of 8 MOX gas sensors, and a temperature and humidity sensor. This sensor array was exposed to background home activity while subject to two different stimuli: wine and banana. The responses to banana and wine stimuli were recorded by placing the stimulus close to the sensors. The duration of each stimulation varied from 7min to 2h, with an average duration of 42min. This dataset contains a set of time series from three different conditions: wine, banana and background activity. There are 36 inductions with wine, 33 with banana and 31 recordings of background activity. One possible application is to discriminate among background, wine and banana.
